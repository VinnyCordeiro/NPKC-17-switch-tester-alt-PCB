# NPKC-17-switch-tester-alt-PCB
Alternative PCB to convert the NPKC 17 switch tester (https://www.massdrop.com/buy/npkc-switch-tester?mode=guest_open or https://www.massdrop.com/buy/npkc-17-switch-tester?mode=guest_open) into a number pad. It is small enough to be modified with the free version of [EAGLE](https://cadsoft.io/).

The Atmel ATmega32U2 microcontroller can be programmed with the [tmk keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard). An specific fork for this PCB can be found [here](https://github.com/VinnyCordeiro/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/keyboard/AUNK_Numpad).

As of September 13, 2016, the design is still untested.
